  @title A minimalistic, gas-efficient ERC-721 implementation forked from the

  Compared to the original `Super721` implementation that this contract forked
  from, this is a very pared-down contract that includes simple delegated
  minting and transfer locks.

  This contract includes the gas efficiency techniques graciously shared with
  the world in the specific ERC-721 implementation by Chiru Labs that is being
  called "ERC-721A" (https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A). We have validated
  this contract against their test cases.

  /**
    This function allows permissioned minters of this contract to mint one or
    more tokens dictated by the `_amount` parameter. Any minted tokens are sent
    to the `_recipient` address.

    Note that tokens are always minted sequentially starting at one. That is,
    the list of token IDs is always increasing and looks like [ 1, 2, 3... ].
    Also note that per our use cases the intended recipient of these minted
    items will always be externally-owned accounts and not other contracts. As a
    result there is no safety check on whether or not the mint destination can
    actually correctly handle an ERC-721 token.

    @param _recipient The recipient of the tokens being minted.
    @param _amount The amount of tokens to mint.
